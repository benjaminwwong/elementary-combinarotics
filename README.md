# elementary-combinarotics
This repository houses a variety of mathematical objects that would be of use to mathematicians and students studying combinatorics.

Beggining with the orthodox permutation, combination, and factorial operations, it allows basic verification of computations.
It provides models for sets, and accounts for the algebra formal power series and indeterminates. Furthermore, it's written in C for python allowing researchers the ease of use of python, but with the efficiency of c.
